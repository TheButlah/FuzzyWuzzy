# FuzzyWuzzy
FuzzyWuzzy is a fast and easy to use Fuzzy Logic library for Java. Specifically, it is a zero-order Sugeno-Type Fuzzy Inference System. This makes it very fast and simple to use.

## What is Fuzzy Logic?
Fuzzy logic is a technique in AI that allows logic rules to be described in a manner similar to how a human would solve a problem. It is also capable of dealing with uncertainty and contradiction in the logic, and is extremely flexible and quite fast. This makes it well suited to difficult and vague real world problems. More info can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/what-is-fuzzy-logic.html), [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/foundations-of-fuzzy-logic.html), and [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/fuzzy-inference-process.html). Often usinig a FIS like FuzzyWuzzy will allow your code to change from a mess of convoluted if statements into something much more simple and elegant.

## How do I use the code?
