# FuzzyWuzzy
FuzzyWuzzy is a fast and easy to use Fuzzy Logic library for Java. Specifically, it is a zero-order Sugeno-Type Fuzzy Inference System.

## What is FuzzyLogic?
Fuzzy logic is a technique in AI that allows logic rules to be described in a manner similar to how a human would solve a problem. It is also capable of dealing with uncertainty and contradiction in the logic, and is extremely flexible and quite fast. This makes it well suited to difficult and vague real world problems.
